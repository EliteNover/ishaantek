# Backstory
Ishaantek has been stealing peoples codes and not crediting people for it so I've decided to compile all his websites code and put it available publicly with credits from the original source codes owner. 

This evidence has been proven by [vCodes](https://vcodes.xyz) Staff for denying his Discord Bot for cloning another GitHub Open Sourced bot and not placing credits anywhere visible. This has also been proven by owner of VitalList [BrydenIsNotSmart](https://github.com/BrydenIsNotSmart) because screenshots emerged of the open source bot list being used without credits.
