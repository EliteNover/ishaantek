# Backstory & Information as to why I'm doing this
Ishaantek has been stealing peoples codes and not crediting people for it so I've decided to compile all his websites code and put it available publicly with credits from the original source codes owner. 

This evidence has been proven by [vCodes](https://vcodes.xyz) Staff for denying his Discord Bot for cloning another GitHub Open Sourced bot and not placing credits anywhere visible. This has also been proven by owner of VitalList [BrydenIsNotSmart](https://github.com/BrydenIsNotSmart) because screenshots surfaced of the open source bot list being used without credits.

## Be Careful
If Ishaantek is using other peoples open sourced projects without providing credits, This must mean there may be some kind of malware embedded into each project without anybody knowing. Be careful and visit and use each project with risk. This also includes the extensions that he "has made" on the Google Extensions Store

### Proof of No Credits on UniverseList:
