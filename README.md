# DISCLAIMER!
Do not go after Ishaantek or anyone else mentioned in this GitHub Repository. All this information has already been reported to relevant authorities, such as Discord, DMCA, etc...  
You are doing nothing useful by going after them.

# Backstory & Information as to why I'm doing this
Ishaantek has been stealing peoples' code and not crediting people for it so I've decided to compile all his websites' code and made it available publicly with credit to the original source code author. You could say it's a taste of his own medicine.

People like Ishaantek put people off making projects open-source. We need to support open-source project developers for their hard work for creating such projects. If people want to create a Discord Bot or a website they should learn the language and take inspiration from the open source developers code, or you could use their open source project and **PROVIDE CREDIT**, doing so supports them and the hard work they have put into their project. There are of course exceptions for the necessity of providing credit, such as if their project's license states you are not required to provide credits, then you do not have to. However, if their license does not say anything about crediting the author, it's best to assume you are to give them credit. If it does say you need to provide credits then **YOU MUST** provide credit on your version of the code from the open source project owner.

Ishaantek also claims to be 13 years of age, however this is untrue as he has been claiming this for over 2 years.

This evidence has been proven by [vCodes](https://vcodes.xyz) staff for denying his Discord Bot for cloning another open-source GitHub bot and not placing credits anywhere visible. This has also been proven by owner of VitalList [BrydenIsNotSmart](https://github.com/BrydenIsNotSmart) because screenshots surfaced of the open-source bot list being used without credits.

## Be Careful
If Ishaantek is using other peoples open-source projects without providing credits, this could mean there may be malware embedded into each project without anyone knowing. Be careful and visit and use each project with caution. This also includes the extensions that he "has made" on the Google Extensions Store

## Challenge Me.
